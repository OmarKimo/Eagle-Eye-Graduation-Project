###Main objective :
Eagle Eye is a project aimed at helping the government find illegal residential
buildings on agricultural lands. It automates the process of segmenting satellite
images into vector maps. This is done by applying machine learning algorithms
on a large amount of satellite data. Then, it checks the list of detected buildings
within agricultural land against a user-provided list of permits.
